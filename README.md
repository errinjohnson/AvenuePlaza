Note: This project will also be best served with the foundation
of Best Practices and Responsive Design, including but not limited
to maintaining code and updates.  

To create a user friendly modules that can aid in teaching
residence the basics of computer software, hardware and internet.
Stepping stone to Cloud Computing.  Internet based instructions, 
so residence can practice at home with thier PC or Notebook with purpose and focus;
meet up once a week for questions and support.  

I would like to create a foundation basic computer course that other communities
can extrapulate from and make their own, based on their needs and skill set.  
Flexible and Intuitive Course based on communities needs.  The purpose is to
pass this program on to other residence within the community, who became empowered
thru the course and wishes to particate and contribute, creating a mindset of 
coherhence and cooperation vs. the old ill informed survial of the fittest mentality.
